The conveyor belt systems are important in the mining, cement, steel, power generating industries as well as handling materials. Nonetheless, another most urgent problem of such systems is the damage during loading points when heavy or sharp materials drop on the conveyor belt. This unexpected force may result in the wear of the belts, tearing, misalignment, and unproductive down time. In order to address this issue, Impact Rollers (or Impact Idlers) are applied.



At Movo Belting Industries, we produce high performance Impact Rollers which are specifically designed to absorb the shocks, minimize vibration and ensure protection of conveyor belts at loading position. Using our skill and precision engineering, we make sure that your conveyor system is smooth and efficient and with minimal maintenance costs.



What is an Impact Roller?

Impact Roller is a conveyor roller that has a special design and is equipped with rubber rings or discs that are covered with shock absorbing material. These rollers are placed at loading points of the conveyor material where they fall onto the belt. The rubber rings absorb the impact therefore avoiding the destruction of the belt and limiting the spillage of materials.



Impact Rollers do not only lengthen the conveyor belt but also augment the productivity and general performance of the conveyor system. They form a vital part of the industries where heavy loads are to be dealt with and the working conditions are harsh.

Belt misalignment is one of the key issues in any conveyor system. When a conveyor belt loses its right course the result is a spillage of material, higher wear and tear, loss of time and maintenance costs. Guide Rollers (Guide Idlers) are employed to eradicate this problem in industries.



At Industry: Movo Belting Industries., we produce high quality Guide Rollers which have been specially made to maintain the conveyor belts at the right position during their operation. The design of our rollers is precise to provide flawless operation, less belt breakage, and long life span of your conveyor system.



What is a Guide Roller?

Guide Roller is a special idler that is provided on the sides of the conveyor belt system. Guide rollers do not directly carry the belt load as does a carrying or impact roller. They instead ensure that the belt does not go off-track and as such the belt edges are not damaged and thus the belt does not go out of track and the company does not lose valuable working time.



These rollers serve as a safety system and are important where heavy handling of materials which are carried out continuously happens.
